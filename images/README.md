# Images

This holds any images on the main README, and the base files for the icons and banner. The font used pre-0.5.0, like Jellyfin, is [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) by Andrew Paglinawan. These old versions are prefixed with `-quicksand` in `src/`.

Post-0.5.0, the font used is Hanken Grotesk, available under SIL OFL 1.1 License.
